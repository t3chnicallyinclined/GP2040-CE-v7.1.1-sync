# GP2040-CE NOBD — Agent Context File

## What Is This Project?

A fork of GP2040-CE v0.7.12 that adds **NOBD (No OBD)** — a firmware-level sync window that groups near-simultaneous button presses so they arrive on the same USB frame. Built for fighting game players who need reliable dashes, throw techs, and multi-button inputs without resorting to OBD (One Button Dash) macros.

## The Problem

When you press LP+HP for a dash, your fingers are naturally 1-3ms apart. USB polls every 1ms. If those two presses land on opposite sides of a USB poll boundary, the game sees them on **different frames** — LP arrives alone, then HP next frame. Result: stray jab instead of dash.

## The Solution

The sync window holds the first press for a configurable number of ms (default 5ms) so the second press can catch up. Both get committed together on the same frame.

**Key property: zero added latency at 5ms.** Stock GP2040-CE already debounces every input at 5ms. NOBD replaces that debounce with a smarter sync window — same total delay, but it groups presses instead of just filtering bounce.

## Architecture — Where Things Live

### Core Sync Window
- **`src/gp2040.cpp`** — `debounceGpioGetAll()` (lines ~250-302)
  - The entire NOBD algorithm lives here
  - Static state machine: `sync_pending`, `sync_start`, `sync_new`
  - Releases are instant (never delayed)
  - All inputs (directions + buttons) go through the window
  - `debounceDelay == 0` → raw passthrough, no sync

### Configuration
- **`proto/config.proto`** — `debounceDelay` is field 11 in `GamepadOptions`
- **`src/config_utils.cpp`** — `DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_DELAY` = 5 (lines ~125-127)
  - Initialized via `INIT_UNSET_PROPERTY` at line ~302
- **`www/src/Pages/SettingsPage.jsx`** — Web UI slider (lines ~1693-1706)
  - `min={0}` `max={5000}`, yup validation: `yup.number().required()`
  - No server-side clamping — 0 is a valid value

### Finger Gap Tester (Rust GUI)
All in **`tools/finger-gap-tester/`**:
- `src/main.rs` — Entry point, eframe window, dark theme with teal accent
- `src/app.rs` — Two-tab UI: Gap Tester + Button Monitor
- `src/input.rs` — **Dedicated 8kHz polling thread** (not on UI thread). Processes one ButtonPressed per gilrs poll cycle for accurate timestamps. Sends events to UI via mpsc channel.
- `src/stats.rs` — Gap statistics, histogram, recommendation formula: `max(3, ceil(avg) + 1)`
- `src/monitor.rs` — Per-button hold duration, repress timing, activation stats

Dependencies: `eframe` 0.33, `egui` 0.33, `egui_plot` 0.34, `gilrs` 0.11

### Finger Gap Tester (Python)
- **`test_finger_gap.py`** — Lightweight alternative using pygame. Same 50ms pair window, same stats.

### Build System
- **`build_fw.bat`** — Windows build script (MSVC + Ninja + CMake)
- Board config: `GP2040_BOARDCONFIG=RP2040AdvancedBreakoutBoard`
- Output: `build/GP2040-CE-NOBD_0.7.12_RP2040AdvancedBreakoutBoard.uf2`

## How the Sync Window Works

```
1. New press detected (raw_gpio bit goes 0→1)
2. If no window open: start window, record press in sync_new bitmask
3. If window already open: accumulate press into sync_new
4. Every cycle: sync_new &= raw_gpio (drop any press that was released = bounce filtering)
5. When (now - sync_start) >= debounceDelay: commit sync_new to debouncedGpio
6. Releases ALWAYS apply immediately (gamepad->debouncedGpio &= ~just_released)
```

The bounce filtering is key — it's not "wait 5ms and hope bounce settled." The code continuously validates pending presses against actual GPIO state. If a switch bounces off then back on, the momentary off gets caught by step 4.

---

## Design Decisions (and why)

1. **5ms default, not 8ms** — Testing showed natural finger gaps are 1-3ms. 5ms covers virtually everyone. Same as stock debounce = zero added latency.

2. **Directions go through sync window** — Originally bypassed for "zero latency directions." Removed because QCB+KK would desync: direction arrives instant, buttons delayed by window → game sees wrong move.

3. **Releases are instant** — Charge characters (Megaman, Sentinel) need immediate release detection. The sync window only applies to presses.

4. **Input thread at 8kHz** — gilrs on Windows uses XInput (polling API, no event timestamps). Processing all events on the UI thread gave 0ms gaps (tight loop) or ~4ms gaps (frame-rate limited). Dedicated thread with 0.125ms sleep matches Python's accuracy.

5. **Recommendation based on average, not max** — One slow outlier shouldn't inflate the recommendation. `max(3, ceil(avg) + 1)` gives 1ms headroom above typical gap, floor of 3ms.

6. **OBD detection** — If >50% of measured gaps are <0.1ms, the user likely has OBD or a macro button active. Warn them to turn it off for accurate measurement.

## Building

### Firmware
```powershell
# From repo root on Windows with MSVC installed:
.\build_fw.bat
# Or manually:
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGP2040_BOARDCONFIG=RP2040AdvancedBreakoutBoard -DPICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT=on
cmake --build build
```

### Web UI (must rebuild before firmware if you changed www/)
```powershell
cd www
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
# Then rebuild firmware — web assets get embedded via makefsdata
```

### Finger Gap Tester
```powershell
cd tools/finger-gap-tester
cargo build --release
# Output: target/release/finger-gap-tester.exe
```

### Release Upload
```powershell
gh release upload v0.7.12-NOBD build/GP2040-CE-NOBD_*.uf2 --clobber
gh release upload v0.7.12-NOBD tools/finger-gap-tester/target/release/finger-gap-tester.exe --clobber
```

## Files Changed from Stock GP2040-CE v0.7.12

| File | What Changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/gp2040.cpp` | Replaced `debounceGpioGetAll()` with sync window algorithm |
| `src/config_utils.cpp` | `DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_DELAY` remains 5 (unchanged, but worth noting) |
| `README.md` | Complete rewrite for NOBD documentation |
| `.gitignore` | Added `tools/finger-gap-tester/target/` |
| `test_finger_gap.py` | New file — Python gap tester |
| `tools/finger-gap-tester/` | New directory — Rust GUI gap tester |

**Everything else is stock GP2040-CE v0.7.12.** The sync window is entirely self-contained in `debounceGpioGetAll()`.

## Common Tasks

### Change the default sync window value
Edit `src/config_utils.cpp`, change `DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_DELAY`. Rebuild firmware.

### Change the recommendation formula
Edit `tools/finger-gap-tester/src/stats.rs` → `recommended_nobd()` and `test_finger_gap.py` → bottom section.

### Add a new board
Copy an existing config from `configs/`, modify pin mappings. Build with `-DGP2040_BOARDCONFIG=YourBoardName`.

### Change the web UI label for the setting
Edit `www/src/Locales/en/SettingsPage.jsx` — find the debounce delay translation key.
